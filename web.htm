<h4>What is the web?</h4>
<p><img src="images/www.jpg" class="img-responsive "width="320" height="250" alt = "">
“The World Wide Web (WWW) or Web is one set of software services running on the Internet.
 The Internet itself is a global, interconnected network of computing devices.
 This network supports a wide variety of interactions and communications between its devices.
 The World Wide Web is a subset of these interactions and supports websites and URIs”.<br>
 (Diffen 2015)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>What is the website?</h4>

<p>
“A website is a collection of Web pages, images, videos or other digital assets that
 is hosted on one or several Web server(s), usually accessible via the Internet or cell phone”.<br>
 (What is a Website? 2015)</p>
 <br>
  <h4>What is the web page?</h4>
  <p>“The web page is a document, typically written in HTML, which is almost always accessible via HTTP,
  a protocol that transfers information from the Web server to display in the user's Web browser”.<br>
  (What is a Website? 2015)</p>
  <br>
  <h4> What is URL?</h4>
  <p><img src="images/webs.jpg" class="img-responsive "width="320" height="250" alt = "">
  "<b>Uniform Resource Locator</b>, a URL or Internet address is a form of URI and is
  a standardized naming convention for addressing documents accessible over the Internet or Intranet.
  An example of a URL is http://www.computerhope.com, which is the URL for the Computer Hope website.
  Below is additional information about each of the sections of the http URL for this page.</p>
  <div class = "row">
  <img src="images/url.gif" class="img-responsive "width="500" height="" alt = "" style="float:left;margin-left:20px;">
  </div>
  <p>The <b>http://</b> stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and enables the browser to know what
  protocol it is going to use to access the information specified in the domain.
  An alternative protocol you may see while on the Internet is FTP.</p>
  
  <p>Next,<b> www.</b> that stands for World Wide Web, is used to distinguish the content.
  This portion of the URL is not required, and many times can be left out. For example,
  typing "http://computerhope.com" would still get you to the Computer Hope web page. 
  This portion of the address can also be substituted for an important sub page known as a subdomain.
  For example, http://support.microsoft.com is the support section of Microsoft's page.</p>
  
  <p>Next,<b> computerhope.com</b> is the domain name for the website.
  The last portion of the domain is known as the "domain suffix"
  or TLD and is used to identify the type or location of website. 
  For example, .com is short for commercial, .org is short for organization, 
  and .co.uk is United Kingdom. There are dozens of other domain suffixes available.</p>
  
  <p>Next, the <b>jargon</b> and <b>u</b> portions of the above URL are the directories of
  where on the server the web page. In this example, the web page is two directories deep,
  so if you were trying to find the file on the server it would be in the /public_html/jargon/u directory.</p>
  
  <p>Finally,<b> url.htm</b> is the actual web page on the domain you're viewing.
  The trailing .htm is the file extension of the web page that indicates the file is an HTML file.
  Other common file extensions on the Internet include .php, .asp, .cgi, .xml, .jpg, and .gif.
  Each of these file extensions performs a different function, 
  just like all the different types of files on your computer. 
  See our index.htm definition for additional information about this important file".<br>
  (Computer Hope 2015)</p>
  <br>
 <h4> What is web browser?</h4>
 
 <p><img src="images/browsers.png" class="img-responsive "width="320" height="250" alt = "">
 “Web browser, a browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the
 World Wide Web, including Web pages, images, video and other files. As a client/server model, the browser
 is the client run on a computer that contacts the Web server and requests information.
 The Web server sends the information back to the Web browser which displays the results
 on the computer or other Internet-enabled device that supports a browser.</p>
 
<p>Today's browsers are fully-functional software suites that can interpret and display HTML Web pages,
 applications, JavaScript, AJAX and other content hosted on Web servers. Many browsers offer plug-ins which extend 
 the capabilities of the software so it can display multimedia information (including sound and video), 
 or the browser can be used to perform tasks such as videoconferencing, to design web pages or add anti-phishing
 filters and other security features to the browser.</p>
 
<p>The two most popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Firefox.
 Other major browsers include Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Opera.
 While most commonly use to access information on the web, a browser can also be used 
 to access information hosted on Web servers in private networks”. <br>
 (Vangie Beal 2015)</p>

 <h4>What Is Web Hosting?</h4>
 
 <p>“Web hosting is the service that makes your website available to be viewed by others on the Internet.
 A web host provides space on its server, so that other computers around the world can access your
 website by means of a network or modem. There are literally thousands of web hosting services available today,
 ranging from free services with limited options to expensive, specialized business web hosting services.
 Which option you choose depends primarily on how you plan to use your website and how much you want to spend”.<br>
 (freeservers 2015)</p>
 
<p>The Web Hosting consists of two main types, such as <b>Free Web Hosting, Paid Web Hosting</b>.</p>

<p><b>Free web hosting</b> is another good option for smaller, personal websites.
 There are many free hosting providers that offer all types of features.
 The drawback to most free hosting services is that they are funded by advertising 
 that appears on your site, so free web hosting so generally best for personal,
 rather than business, websites.</p>
 
 <p>With <b>Paid web hosting</b>, you pay a fee for space and services on a web hosting provider's server.
 Monthly fees can range from a few dollars to several hundred dollars. Obviously,
 the more you pay, the more features you should have at your disposal.
 Services can include CGI access, database support, ASP, e-commerce, SSL,
 additional space on the server, extra bandwidth, and more.<br>

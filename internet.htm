<h4>What is the Internet?</h4>

<p><img src="images/inter.png" class="img-responsive "width="320" height="250" alt = "">
The Internet, is a worldwide system of computer networks or a network of networks 
that use the TCP/IP set of network protocols to reach billions of users.
 It is of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world 
 via dedicated routers and servers. When two computers or other devices
 are connected over the Internet, they can send and receive all kinds 
 of information such as text, graphics, voice, video, and other applications.<br>
 (businessDictionary 2015).</p>

<p>
Today, the Internet serves as a global data communications system that links millions of private,
 public, academic and business networks via an international telecommunications backbone
 that consists of various electronic and optical networking technologies.<br>
 (Investintech 2015).
</p>
<br>
<h4>How the Internet works?</h4>

<p><img src="images/diagram.gif" class="img-responsive "width="320" height="250" alt = "">
"The internet is a world-wide network of computers linked together by telephone wires,
 satellite links and other means. For simplicity's sake we will say that all computers on
 the internet can be divided into two categories: servers and browsers.</p>
 
<p><b>Servers</b> are where most of the information on the internet "lives". 
These are specialised computers which store information, share information with other servers,
 and make this information available to the general public.</p>
 
<p><b>Browsers</b> are what people use to access the World Wide Web from any standard computer. 
Chances are, the browser you're using to view this page is eitherNetscape 
Navigator/Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. These are by far the most popular browsers,
 but there are also a number of others in common use.</p>
 
<p>When you connect your computer to the internet, you are connecting to a special type 
of server which is provided and operated by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
 The job of this "ISP Server" is to provide the link between your browser and the rest of the internet.
 A single ISP server handles the internet connections of many individual browsers - there may
 be thousands of other people connected to the same server that you are connected to right now.</p>
 
<p>The following picture shows a small "slice" of the internet with several home computers connected
 to a server".<br>

<h4>History of the Internet</h4>
<p>The internet was established by the US Department of Defence in 1960s
 for collaboration in military research among business and government laboratories and called “ARPANET”.</p>
<p>In 1969, ARPANET delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to another.</p>

<p>By the end of 1969, just four computers were connected to the ARPANET, 
but the network grew steadily during the 1970s. In 1971, it added the University
 of Hawaii’s ALOHAnet, and two years later it added networks at London’s University
 College and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway. As packet-switched computer
 networks multiplied, however, it became more difficult for them to integrate into a single worldwide “Internet.”</p>

<p>By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf had begun to solve 
this problem by developing a way for all of the computers on all of the world’s mini-networks 
to communicate with one another. He called his invention “Transmission Control Protocol,” or TCP. 
(Later, he added an additional protocol, known as “Internet Protocol.” The acronym we use to refer 
to these today is TCP/IP.) One writer describes Cerf’s protocol as “the ‘handshake’ that introduces 
distant and different computers to each other in a virtual space.”<p>

<p>Since then, the Internet has changed in many ways. In 1992, a group of students and researchers
 at the University of Illinois developed a sophisticated browser that they called Mosaic. 
 Mosaic offered a user-friendly way to search the Web: It allowed users to see words
 and pictures on the same page for the first time and to navigate using scrollbars and clickable links.
 That same year, Congress decided that the Web could be used for commercial purposes.
 As a result, companies of all kinds hurried to set up websites of their own, and e-commerce
 entrepreneurs began to use the Internet to sell goods directly to customers. More recently,
 social networking sites like Facebook have become a popular way for people of all ages to stay connected.</p>
 
<p>Today, almost one-third of the world’s 6.8 billion people use the Internet regularly. <br>

<h4>What is E-Commerce?</h4>

<p><img src="images/commerce.jpg" class="img-responsive "width="320" height="250" alt = "">
“The buying and selling of products and services by businesses and consumers through
 an electronic medium, without using any paper documents. E-commerce is widely considered
 the buying and selling of products over the internet, but any transaction that is completed
 solely through electronic measures can be considered e-commerce. E-commerce is subdivided into
 three categories: business to business or B2B (Cisco), business to consumer or B2C (Amazon),
 and consumer to consumer or C2C (eBay). also called electronic commerce”.<br>
 (InvestorsWords 2015)</p>
<br>
<h4>Categories of E-Commerce</h4>

<p>“<b>B2B </b>(Business to Business) — This involves companies doing business with each other.
 One example is manufacturers selling to distributors and wholesalers selling to retailers”.<br>
 (Katherine Arline 2015)</p>
 
 <p>“<b>B2C </b>(Business to Consumer) — B2C consists of businesses selling to the general public through 
 shopping cart software, without needing any human interaction. This is what most people think
 of when they hear "e-commerce." An example of this would be Amazon”.<br>
 (Katherine Arline 2015)</p>
 
 <p>“<b>C2C</b> (Consumer to Consumer) — this takes place within online classified ads,
 forums or marketplaces where individuals can buy and sell their goods. Examples of
 this include Craigslist, eBay and Etsy”.<br>
 (Katherine Arline 2015)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>Benefits of E-Commerce</h4>
 <p>Ecommerce allows people to carry out businesses without the barriers of time or distance.
 One can log on to the Internet at any point of time, be it day or night and purchase or sell
 anything one desires at a single click of the mouse.</p>
 <p>The direct cost-of-sale for an order taken from a web site is lower than through
 traditional means (retail, paper based), as there is no human interaction during the on-line
 electronic purchase order process. Also, electronic selling virtually eliminates processing errors,
 as well as being faster and more convenient for the visitor.</p>
 
 <p>Another important benefit of Ecommerce is that it is the cheapest means of doing business.</p>
<p>From the buyer’s perspective also ecommerce offers a lot of tangible advantages, such as better buyer decisions,
 increased opportunities for buying alternative products, document preparation, telephone calling and credit
 card machines.<br>
